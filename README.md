## Flet Jeopardy

This repository supports a tutorial to be published on 
my [YouTube Channel @CodingJQ](https://github.com/codingjq/flet-jeopardy).

I hope you find it helpful to learn how to set up an interactive Jeopardy-style board in Flet!

Special thanks to https://opentdb.com for the quiz questions.
